# Compact Perception: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Mine High-Dimensional Complex Dynamical Systems

The code to reproduce the results in the paper Gupta et al. "Compact Perception: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Mine High-Dimensional Complex Dynamical Systems".

**Language:** The code package is available in Matlab

For getting the compresison-prediction tade-off run:
```
>> predCompressPlot.m
```

For the rank variation vs Lagrange parameters, run:
```
>> rankPlotData.m
```
